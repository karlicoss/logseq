NOTE: for some reason some python3 -m http.server isn't working properly... but works in prod?
- export public pages
  NOTE: seems that it might be useful sometimes to remove the graph and reimport again before exporning.. ugh
- copy index.html from download here (UPD no need to it reads Downloads)
- run split.py (it will move index.py and separate graph into current dir)
- run yarn release-publishing
- run sync script??
  cd into the result dir, review changes & commit everything
- push both to github and beepb00p
